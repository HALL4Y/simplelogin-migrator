## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this project seriously, especially since it handles API Keys.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **DO NOT** open a public issue. This would expose other users to risk.

### How to report properly?
Please use the **Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature on GitHub:

1. Go to the **Security** tab of this repository.
2. Click on the **"Report a vulnerability"** button.
3. Describe the issue in detail.

This allows us to discuss the problem privately and release a fix before the vulnerability becomes public knowledge.

Thank you for helping keep this tool safe!
